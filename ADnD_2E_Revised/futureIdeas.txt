- Wizards needs a complete alchemical laboratory. The basic cost is at least 2,000 gp for the equipment and furnishings. The location and housing is added on top of this cost. The wizard must pay 10% of its value every month for maintenance. DMG p. 120
- Priests need an alter specially consecrated to the purpose of brewing potions. DMG p. 120

- Preparing the materials takes from 2 weeks to a month and costs at least 500 gold pieces, if not more. DMG p. 121
Wizards
- First cast _Enchant an Item_ (or have another do it for them) then perform whatever is needed. DMG p. 121
- If no _permanency_ spell is cast in the end, the vessel only holds charges equal to the number of spells cast upon it. DMG p. 121
- Success is known by the DM. DMG p. 121
Priests. DMG p. 121
- Must first find the vessel of the finest or most perfect materials
- The priest must then spend two weeks in meditation and purification ceremonies and then another week in fasting and purification, to purify himself
- Then he must likewise purify the item and seek to invoke it a small portion of his deity's grandeur. This takes a single day and night.
- As the item rests upon an alter, the priest must pray for the blessed sign that the deity will endow the vessel with the desired powers. Each day there is a 1% cumulative chance that the prayers will be heard.
- Once complete the item needs to be sanctified and consecrated for a permanent enchant
- For charges, the priest have 24 hours to cast the appropriate spells into the item
